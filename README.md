# Ensemble-Techniques-Bagging-and-Random--Forest
The objective is to build a model that predicts if someone seeking a loan might be a defaulter or a non defaulter; making the target variable "default". Furthermore we want to determine which features are the most important in the model building process and which model is the best performing model that minimizes risk of financial loss.
